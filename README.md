# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.

This is my LazyVim configuration setup. I realised I have been fumbling with
testing different plugins, and I decided a version control makes my life easier.
Moving forward, I should be more able to test different Neovim configuration set
ups.

For example, currently I am stuck with my Quarto-Neovim setup, so if anyone has
any ideas, I am happy to get some advice!
